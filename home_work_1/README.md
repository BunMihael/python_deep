# Homework 1 — Python Deep Dive

This folder contains additional programming assignments.

## Files
| File             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `frame.py`       | Draw ASCII frame (rectangle) with given width, height, and border symbols. |
| `hole.py`        | Build numeric "pit": descending numbers on the left, dots in the middle, ascending on the right. |
| `is_prime.py`    | Count how many prime numbers are in a given sequence. |
| `triangle.py`    | Classify a triangle by its sides: equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or invalid. |
| `guess_number.py`| Game “Computer guesses your number”. Two modes: deterministic (binary search, ≤7 attempts for range 1..100) and randomized. |

## Example
```bash
$ python guess_number.py
Choose mode: 1 — deterministic, 2 — randomized: 1
Think of a number between 1 and 100. I'll try to guess it.
...
I guessed it in 6 attempts!
