| `triangle.py`   | Classify a triangle by its sides: equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or invalid. |
| `guess_number.py` | Game "Computer guesses your number". Two modes: deterministic (binary search, ‚â§7 attempts for range 1..100) and randomized. |

## Example
```bash
$ python guess_number.py
Choose mode: 1 ‚Äî deterministic, 2 ‚Äî randomized: 1
Think of a number between 1 and 100. I'll try to guess it.
...
I guessed it in 6 attempts!
